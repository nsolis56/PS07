## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(babynames)

babynames %>% 
  filter(name == "Minnie") %>% 
  group_by(name)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = babynames, mapping = aes(x= year, y = prop, color = sex)) +
geom_line() +
scale_color_manual(values = c("#ee2c2c" , "#e3dac9")) +
labs (x = "Year", y = "Proportion", title = "Minnie")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
